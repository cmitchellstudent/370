Beyond the fact that it's still uproariously funny \u2014 the \"franks and beans\"\u00a0sequence has such a nightmarish quality and every scene with the dog kills \u2014 it's a pretty effective portrait of male psychosis. Nobody comes off looking particularly great in this movie, except Mary, of course.

But I knew that in 1998 when all the cool kids in my school wore it and I was mocked for not wearing it. And this really doesn't have much more to say beyond that for 90 minutes. It barely even explores how the company got so big or why they became so popular. If the place sucks \u2014 and apparently almost everyone agrees it sucks, at least in this documentary \u2014\u00a0there's got to be a lot more to its success than shopping bags with pictures of half naked guys on them.

Julia Winter makes a wicked Veruca Salt, and Freddie Highmore is a very sweet Charlie. Then Depp shows up and throws the whole thing out of whack. His Wonka is all eccentricities; there's zero warmth and barely any menace, the unique combination that made Wilder's Willy such a fascinating creation. Depp's version is just a weirdo, one further defanged with the addition of a...     ",

Everyone else had the right idea; by the end I was so bored I started wandering the auditorium trying out different seats to find the best angle on the screen. No matter where I sat, though, the movie still sucked. 20 years later, Bulletproof Monk really might contain this century's worst Hollywood martial arts scenes. It may not entirely be...     ",

      "they-came-together": "7/10 The best bit I did not remember from my previous viewing is Christopher Meloni wearing a skintight superhero costume to a Halloween party, then having to take a dump and not being able to get out of it in time, then shitting himself, then changing costumes, then trying to explain to the rest of the party guests why he is now undressed while his superhero costume is filled with crap on the bathroom floor. It's weird how Meloni is never funny in anything except David Wain movies, but in David Wain movies he's the funniest man who ever lived.     ",

      "marty": "6/10 Nothing significantly wrong with this, but I saw the Philco Television Playhouse version multiple times in college, and I prefer that one. The story works better at an hour than at 90 minutes \u2014 or at least the new scenes don't add anything significant \u2014 and Rod Steiger and Nancy Marchand brought a rougher, darker edge to the sadness surrounding Marty and Clara than Ernest Borgnine and Betsy Blair.

      "scream-4": "5/10 This film struggles with a lack of focus for its satire. The first Scream plays with the tropes of slasher movies; Scream 2 is about sequels, Scream 3 pokes fun at trilogies' rules. What they're about and what they're making fun of is crystal clear. Sometimes, Scream 4 is about remakes \u2014 even though it is not actually a remake, it's a sequel \u2014\u00a0and sometimes it is about YouTube culture. Both concepts are totally valid ones for Scream movies, but...     ",

But why is a movie about an unscrupulous Broadway producer who learns absolutely nothing and never changes in any way over the course of his life three hours long?!?

The reason why he didn't return varies by the source \u2014 according to some accounts he wanted to write his own dialogue, in others he simply refused his character's arc \u2014 but either way, replacing him was a significant loss for the film.

I get that its subjects (the effects of aging, the long-term relationship between an employee and their employer) are rarely depicted in Hollywood movies; perhaps that novelty was enough to make it seem special. But it's ultimately just a character study, and not a particularly rich one. 25 years passes, but the film doesn't capture the gradual evolution of its setting or its people. In one...     ",
      "my-fair-lady": "4/10 Magnificent costumes and memorable songs aside, this left me cold. Hepburn seems totally miscast, Harrison is insufferable (by design, I guess?), and neither can sing a lick. (Hepburn's musical numbers are dubbed by another actress, Harrison rhythmically speaks his songs into one of the earliest wireless microphones, a technological breakthrough that allows us to hear ... one of the least appealing voices in musical cinema history.) I was done long before the 150 minute runtime was.     ",

Banderas is hilarious, charming, and ridiculously handsome. Hopkins looks like he's never had more fun as he whips and smokes and browbeats the new Zorro into shape. They should make a second sequel to this with Banderas sliding into the Hopkins role as the older Zorro training the next man (or woman?) to wear the mask.     ",

A squad of heavily armed police officers fighting a woman in black leather. That's the famous opening to The Matrix \u2014 and now it's also the opening to The Matrix Resurrections.

There's this amazing scene where Burt Reynolds, clad in nothing but tiny briefs, inspects his body with total disgust. No dialogue; just withering self-critique.  Hooper is one of the best movies I've ever seen about entering middle age. You're not \"old\" yet, but you're getting there, and knowing it's coming makes it so...     ",

Everything is so fully stylized and unreal that 15 years later all the stuff designed to look \"futuristic\" in 1999 (like the cellular phones that slide open) now works as part of the overall dreamy aesthetic. And it really strikes the perfect balance between serious contemplations of reality and serious displays of asskickery. It's just too bad they never made any sequels. Do you hear me? THEY NEVER MADE ANY SEQUELS.     ",

It features extensive interviews with Kenny G, who comes across like a bright, friendly, harmless dude and a talented saxophone player. It also features tons of critics, historians, experts, and DJs who view him with skepticism, if not with outright disdain \u2014\u00a0and gives them the space to explore why he's a polarizing figure, and also by a...

Yeah, he's directed a bunch of incredible chase sequences (mostly in the Indiana Jones movies), but he made his bones with a very particular kind of picture and then he moved on to other stuff. Obviously, he had lots of other things he wanted to do, and he was, y'know, extremely good at those things too. But I would not mind...     ",

(It's basically all of my anxieties condensed into 70 minutes \u2014 thanks Spielberg, I didn't want to sleep tonight anyway.) The pace and intensity of absolutely nightmarish images seems unsustainable \u2014 and apparently it was, because the final act shifts to something that's much less frightening and then much less bleak. Even if that material has its roots in H.G. Wells' original story, it still doesn't quite fit the magnificent freakout that precedes it.     ",

Larrain makes some interesting visual choices, and he absolutely turns the most opulent Christmas ever into a nightmarish prison of obligation. If only the script hit as many different notes as Jonny Greenwood's score. This is one of those movies where you feel like you get it after 30 minutes, and then there's 90 more minutes after that.     ",

It's like the script was written by Reynolds' publicist.)     ",

Back then, I vaguely recall being more hung up on Tom Hanks' casting; how do you put the quintessential American dad in the role of a bumbling foreigner?

It's also one of Steven Spielberg's last works for television before he moved into full-time moviemaking.

It concerns a family that moves out of the city and into a country house that might have a slight infestation of Satan. It was Spielberg's immediate followup to Duel, and in that context it's impossible not to see it as a disappointment. A few briskly edited moments aside, it's standard TV movie fare right down the line. That said, some of Spielberg's favorite themes \u2014 lost innocence, families confronting supernatural threats to their mental and emotional stability \u2014 are already here in embryonic form.

I prefer to believe the extremely convincing illusion that Villeneuve somehow traveled to the year 10,191 and documented the strange civilization he encountered. Dune is full of stylization and visual artistry, but the future it conjures feel so complete and tactile that some segments play like a documentary of the world to come \u2014 which is an especially impressive feat since that world involves giant sandworms that consume everything that passes through their sphincter-like maws.

But valuable as perhaps the most emblematic example of Hollywood filmmaking circa 2011, a world where the only value of intelligence is in making fights look cooler on screen -- which is exactly what Sherlock Holmes uses his unparalleled intellect to do.

      "universal-soldier-regeneration": "7/10 This movie is really effective for what it is: solid action, grim atmosphere, all on no budget. The previous UNIVERSAL SOLDIER sequel, THE RETURN, made absolutely no sense: a man who'd been brought back to life shows no ill effects from that trauma, physically or mentally, while he fights an evil supercomputer inside the body of Michael Jai White. Absurd (and kind of hilarious as a result). This movie deserves credit for actually presenting a little of the sad reality of what a program like this would look like. And then also having dudes throwing each other through walls, which is good too.     ",

It has this great, bizarre sci-fi premise (YAY!) which largely gets pushed to the background for lame car chases and fist fights (BOO!). It's got a strong political message (YAY!) but it's solution for deeply ingrained social problems is cheap and easy (BOO!). It's about an average guy just trying to survive in an awful world (YAY!) who suddenly...     ",

It doesn't pass The Willmore Test of documentaries: it's about an incredibly interesting subject, but it doesn't look at that subject in an interesting way. The film is about the mystery surrounding these ominous tiles that sprouted up all over the country and even the world in the 1980s, suggesting some sort of plan to resurrect dead people on Jupiter, inspired by Kubrick's 2001. I'd seen these things around my old neighborhood in Manhattan, so...     ",
