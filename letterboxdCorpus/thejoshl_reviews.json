      "the-boss-1973": "8/10 Of the Di Leo Poliziotteschi's I've seen that combine the icy cool gangster hitman neo-noir + the gritty American vigilante cop revenge movie with full-on Italian grindhouse levels of vulgarity and violence, this is perhaps the nastiest one outside of Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man, where he passed off directing duty to Cannibal Holocaust's Ruggero Deodato. In some regions this movie was called Murder Inferno, and honestly, fair.   As far more so than The Italian Connection this...     ",
      "the-italian-connection": "8/10 Another mercilessly bleak and brutally violent mob revenge thriller from the God of the Italian Years of Lead Poliziotteschi, Fernando Di Leo.   This one at first ostensibly pitching itself as a buddy crime caper between Henry Silva and Woody Strode as cool-as-hell American hitmen (in tight florals, bellbottoms and leather jackets) sent to Milan to publicly punish and assassinate a charming, low-level schlubby pimp named Luca Canali (played by a very intense and sweaty Mario Adorf, co-star of Di Leo's...

      "fear-is-the-key": "8/10    Will echo the common sentiment around this film which is that knowing as little as possible about it is the preferred way to experience it, as its absurd plot courtesy of Where Eagles Dare's Alistair MacLean forces it to switch pulp novel genre modes so quickly and recklessly it ties itself into various increasingly (yet enjoyably) twisty knots. In 100 minutes managing to do everything from dangerous Burt Reynolds style off-road Southern car chases (a 15-minute opener that somehow manages...     ",
      "breakheart-pass": "6/10 Murder on the Orient Express as a 1970s macho pulp western, with Charles Bronson as the Civil War-era Secret Service agent Hercule Poirot, who spends just as much time gunslinging and dropkicking dudes atop the moving train as he does solving the murder mystery. The governor gun-smuggling conspiracy paperback plot by Alistair MacLean is fine, but leaves less of an impression than the analog visual craftsmanship courtesy of legendary western and noir cinematographer Lucien Ballard (The Killing, The Wild Bunch,...

      "malone": "6/10 Went into this knowing that Burt was at the point in his career where he was trying to downplay the goofy charm and trying out the kind of stoic, violent revenge movies from this era you could imagine starring Charles Bronson. And in some ways this is that movie, especially when the dick kicks, shotgun squibs, and explosions go off. \"Ex-cop. Ex-CIA. Ex-plosive!\" definitely a new fav tagline.  But I was a bit surprised by how slow and somber of...     ",
      "the-judge-2014": "4/10 With Oppenheimer reminding everyone of what a talented actor Robert Downey Jr. can be, there were a lot of breathless threads about how he's actually been great during these last 10-15 years as well. No renaissance in sight here! He's been doing work this good the whole time! Cited as evidence of this in one of those threads\u2014it seemed by a Marvel fan offended at the implication that Tony Stark was included in people's assessment when they were suggesting that...     ",
      "layer-cake": "6/10 I love the old-school, stylishly made, tonally bleak and ruthless British gangster economy/hierarchy thrillers (you know, the kind that Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins used to do back in the day) so much that not even Matthew Vaughn can fuck it up for me. Don't know why he thought his bad taste for needle drops and \"clever\" humor (which thankfully only briefly pop up here) was what he needed to lean into, instead of Daniel Craig brooding about the ugly job of killing. This is why you never got a shot at a Bond film, mate.     ",

      "american-fiction": "4/10 Interested in checking out the novel to see if any of these satirical ideas play out better there (I imagine they have to), but I'm sorry it's so funny and misguided to aspire to make the mediocre feel-good Oscar dramady version of Bamboozled. One that is deliberately non-radical and far friendlier/more digestible to the exact white liberal elite audience it's ostensibly critiquing. Wright's charmingly frustrated performance deserved a way sharper, more ambitiously made movie.     ",
      "heat": "6/10 In which apparently six directors (including, briefly, Robert Altman) take a crack at legendary novelist-turned-screenwriter William Goldman's Las Vegas for-hire mercenary/gambling addict loser neo-noir pulp novel, and all lose out to the charmingly weary and career-declining middle-aged Burt Reynolds, who ended up punching the credited director so hard he broke his jaw and probably should've just directed it himself after that. The end result is a bit of an episodic mess that alternates on a dime between fading 70s tough...     ",
      "shamus": "6/10 The more disreputable and less artful attempt to update Philip Marlowe for the grislier, sexier 1973; with Burt Reynolds starring as the dirty, swagged-out, perpetually hungover private detective who slowly tugs at the loose threads of a confusing, murderous diamond thieving/gun smuggling operation in his big Columbo trench coat in between various scenes of violent stunt-heavy chases/fights, having sex on his pool table mattress bed (his entire crummy apartment wake-up routine is sick), and hanging out with his best pal,...

But what hasn't is the central sociopathic, symbiotic...     ",
      "thunderball": "6/10 So obviously the most expensive one yet with lots to be technically impressed by: the usual fantastic John Barry music, grand Ken Adam set design, lush Bahamas location work, and some pretty astonishing underwater scuba photography/FX during the finale. Unfortunately it's clear the producers were so focused on making this the grandest yet on a large, widescreen production level (involving the biggest boats and bombs yet!) they didn't really care about how sluggish and bloated it was becoming as an...

      "the-iron-claw-2023": "8/10 Obviously The Wrestler kind of set a precedent for this specific milieu as an access point to a punishingly miserable, intimately shot prestige sports movie tearjerker, and identified wrestling as similar to the rich history of boxing movies in that it's both an athletic occupation with devastating bodily consequences and a stage bound artform that naturally lends itself to a performative identity crisis. But unlike Aronofsky who never met a transcendence-through-suffering narrative he couldn't artfully underline until it felt a...     ",
      "new-jack-city": "8/10 James Cagney type shit. A remarkable, colorful cartoon pastiche by Van Peebles located somewhere between bleak, socially-conscious crack epidemic studio crime saga (\"you gotta rob to get rich in the Reagan era\") and gruesome, bad-taste blaxploitation update on classic Warner gangster films, doing for the 90s what Larry Cohen did in the 70s with Black Caesar right down to the unreal NY location work.

The theory being that she was his possession too so she was supposed to journey into death with him, and the community saw to it that she did. Of course, that doesn't happen anymore.\"  Douglas Sirk's masterfully calibrated, quietly desperate follow-up to the equally gorgeous but much more narratively ridiculous...     ",

Features some very funny and moving clips/interviews with many former lovers and co-stars, including a particularly harrowing one with Linda Evans about the McMillan kiss. Was not expecting confirmation of hog size.     ",
      "lions-for-lambs": "2/10 BREAKING: guilty debate class liberals flirt with joining the war on terror, but in, like, an intellectual devil's advocate type way. A heavy-handed sub-Sorkin play about how it's much easier to apathetically sit around and criticize someone for their mistakes (the US foreign policy post-9/11) than it is to be someone who actually stands up and does something about it (joins the army and get hilariously, pointlessly wiped out by the Taliban). Tom Cruise *IS* Republican Senator Jasper Irving.     ",

Providing a bunch of superficially overactive bombast at the expense of any dramatic sense, a feverishly abstract music video editing style (that I didn't even have to look up to know was courtesy of the guy who cut Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday), and a lot of tacky early-2000s fashion, music, CG, etc....

The Boston Strangler, the Son of Sam; all the stars are here! Ultimately a bit too long and silly tbh,...     ",
      "past-lives": "6/10 Feels a bit unfair to be dinging a movie for simply being a perfectly fine and elegantly, confidently made (though certainly Sundance-friendly) take on the historically effective repressed extramarital longing/melancholy passage of time melodrama. And yet, when the movies you're up against include Bridges of Madison County, In the Mood for Love, Before Sunset, etc... I've seen some praise for the decision to have the husband be so chill about this situation, which I personally found infuriatingly unbelievable\u2014not so much...     ",

Probably because divorced from the Gosling/Stone hype that generated a lot of those reactions it's mostly just a fairly mediocre but charming divorce rom-com, albeit one that's been elevated by some great casting (Carrell plays pathetic and sad well, and Gosling's alpha comedic reactions to him were turned into dozens of iconic gifs for a reason) and some...

Scott's The Hunger and Ferrara's The Addiction do the modern vampire stuff better, Coppola's Dracula the lavish, gory old-timey pastiche... despite some equally insane casting decisions. I'm not sure that Cruise is \"good\" per se but he certainly relishes in the ridiculousness of playing such an...     ",
      "juice": "8/10 The debut of regular Spike Lee cinematographer-turned-director Ernest R. Dickerson is a Harlem high school melodrama that with the mid-film introduction of a gun and a crime-gone-wrong becomes a pulpy and brutal morality play horror movie about the cycle of street power, violence and self-destructive desperation that tragically swallows this friend group. At 95 minutes it makes a few sudden narrative and tonal whiplashes (and you could argue the moralizing is a tad on the heavy-handed side) but there is...     ",

Guess this mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 CIA tradecraft melodrama will have to suffice, even if they don't actually spend much on-screen time together. Tony Scott was a supernaturally gifted stylist so there are some...     ",
      "money-talks": "4/10 The first of what would become many mediocre Joel Silver buddy crime knockoffs between Brett Ratner and Chris Tucker, whose charisma is working on a level of liveliness that Ratner's consistently humdrum direction just never really matched. Luckily for the Rush Hour movies Tucker would at least be paired with Jackie Chan who he actually has some chemistry with, unlike whatever Charlie Sheen is going for here.

      "inside-out-2015": "6/10 Hmmmm. A little more flash than wit, I think, but it's a fine introduction to kids to wrestle with some more complex emotional ideas. The best parts were easily all the brief but weird world-building; felt Wachowski-ish in how it provides fun, occasionally surreal answers for the ordinary things we experience every day - that abstract thought scene, for example.     ",
      "run-all-night": "6/10 Dug it. Not as well-executed as Non-Stop but there's enough of Jaume Collet-Serra's mid-budget kinetic energy (and Liam Neeson growling/lumbering physique) for it to work. Loved the Panic Room-esque fluid connections between scenes/characters; heightened the cat-and-mouse aspect, making everyone feel in tight proximity to one another at all times.     ",
      "jurassic-world": "2/10 A big, dumb, bland repackaging about how big, dumb, bland repackaging's are the worst thing ever. Might be a genius meta-satire if it was made by a filmmaker who had actual control of craft/ideas/character/tone/consistency, etc. but alas. Still struggle to understand how anyone could find this much openly lazy, thoughtless cynicism and contempt \"fun.\" We're talking about a film that gives the most horrifically cruel death to some intern for talking on her phone but then tastefully pans away from...

      "going-clear-scientology-and-the-prison-of-belief": "6/10 Scientology is a fascinating, terrifying topic, however, with the exception of some stellar insider archival footage, Gibney just doesn't really know how to frame these people/stories in a way that's as equally interesting cinematically. A lot of what he treats as visual flourish is just him translating what his subjects are literally saying - feels a bit lazy. Enjoyable and functional for anyone looking for a basic primer/overview of Scientology, but for tackling such an intriguing subject, it's unfortunate it doesn't seem interested in being something more thoughtful or critical than a Wikipedia page.

      "the-birth-of-a-nation": " Perhaps the ugliest film I've ever seen, but also one of the most essential in terms of establishing the language of cinema. Griffith's astonishing photography and montage that would later define a lot of the cinematic vocabulary still used today serves only as a temporary distraction from horrid, overbearing racism; his use of close-ups and cross-cutting, in particular, is just so far beyond what anyone else was doing at the time it's hard to a imagine a world where this...

      "insurgent": "2/10 Ditches the hour-long training montage and modicum of visual flair that director Burger brought to Divergent, making it watchable, and instead doubles down on the incredibly asinine, allegorical teen power-fantasy that equates your mom grounding you from Tumblr (I mean caging your individualism) with dystopian systematic oppression.

It's massive, overly-ambitious, totally nonsensical, and infallibly sincere about its insane world-building design and strangely-calibrated performances. Also just genuinely weird and expressive in ways big movies aren't really allowed to be anymore, and thus destined to be made fun of by the most boring people on the planet. We don't deserve the Wachowski sisters.     ",
      "the-thin-blue-line": "10/10 Despite the decades of poor imitators this is a truly exceptional piece of documentary filmmaking. Morris' haunting, repetitious use of re-enactments that formally bleed from tangible documentation into stylized sensationalism. The way it's constructed to slowly reveal details, letting the audience participate and constantly evaluate then re-evaluate the information we're receiving and our perceptions of those feeding it to us. It all builds to a thoroughly compelling argument that the justice system deals in reconstructed, fictional storytelling just as much as the movies do.     ",
