      "kingsman-the-secret-service": "9/10 feels like a really nice blend of james bond, the dark knight, john wick, etc  the film has its own rules which sometimes makes it confusing but sometimes are incredibly fun. overall glad i watched it     ",

      "slow-west": "7/10 Unique coloring and composition for a western, almost making it Wes Anderson-esque. The movie feels like a bright painting of the west. The painting-like nature of everything sets it up well for a subversive end. Maybe a little thin on supporting the character arcs.  A case study on how chasing hoes will bring your downfall     ",

      "once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood": "10/10 what a gotdamn wild ride, i actually didn't mind the first two acts because there was enough minor conflict to please my monkey brain and it all just felt slice-of-life-ish.  too much lady feet tho, i'm not afraid to kinkshamealso i wouldn't have minded if it was even more on the nose with the charles manson parallels     ",

      "pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl": "9/10 Objectively this movie is probably just decent, but man, I just really like it. The two hours just fly by. Minor flaws be damned, the movie's still fun, especially when it isn't taking itself too seriously and is instead hyping itself up with that iconic Hans Zimmer score. Learning the characters bit by bit is what makes this so rewatchable for me. Gone are the days that a PotC movie is directed by Verbinski, has its original writers, and stars...     ",
      "once-upon-a-time-in-the-west": "7/10 It's a nice western but you really start to notice how confusing or unexplained things tend to be. What could've done the movie better was some more explanatory dialogue or flow between locations. Morricone is on point as always, and there is definitely some wit in the characters, but I can't say the movie amounts to any of the films in the Dollars Trilogy, especially the 2nd and 3rd ones.     ",

      "animal-farm-1999": "4/10 Watched this in school. Bad in a funny kind of way. My favorite part was when they couldn't commit to having 100% puppets so the rats are completely computer generated (and sometimes the pigs).     ",
      "mad-max-fury-road": "10/10 There was clearly some genius at play in making the cars go vroom vroom. Characters are written and performed well too. No complaints all around (just maybe a nitpick or two).     ",
      "for-a-few-dollars-more": "9/10 Greatly improves upon the negatives of Fistful of Dollars, which was already a good movie. For A Few Dollars more is very confident in the directions it takes.  By the way Ennio Morricone is a god     ",
      "a-fistful-of-dollars": "8/10 I liked it. A fun story whose only real issues are some practical effects and the corny acting following a person getting shot. Both of which Leone corrects in later parts of the Dollars Trilogy.     ",
      "burning-cane": "6/10 Great cinematography, but just so slow paced that I dozed off for 15 minutes. Sorry Phillip.  (Saw this through a mandatory screening at NOCCA)     ",
      "pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-mans-chest": "8/10 I don't\u00a0remember how good the movie was but the soundtrack good     ",
      "joker-2019": "9/10 i liked the stairs and the clown makeup. would watch again     ",
      "john-wick-chapter-3-parabellum": "9/10 Though the spontaneous story and repetitive lighting may get under one's skin, the second-to-none action sequences effectively overshadow these shortcomings, showcasing that John Wick 3 nails absurdly entertaining fights and choreography.     "
