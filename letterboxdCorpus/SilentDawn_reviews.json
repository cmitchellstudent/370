Balances the line between bitter sentiment and sports-movie misery quite well. We've seen a million variations of this type of film but this is as gentle and tender as they come.

This is so fucking goofy. Plenty of slapstick bits, bad one-liners, absurd creatures, clumsy ADR. Had a blast watching it aspire to Jules Verne and Ray Harryhausen, even if it fails routinely.

It's enough for the early going, but eventually the movie attempts to resolve itself with a out-of-left-field narrative turn and I just about threw my hands up in frustration. Maybe the worst ending of the year. Loved the gorgeous sets, the cozy 50s glow to the images, and it's a fine excuse to stare at Anne Hathaway for 90 minutes (she's good, so is Thomasin McKenzie).

Never forget when Edward first sees Bella in biology and he seems to orgasm and scream internally all at once, all while Catherine Hardwicke lingers on his clenched fist and the physical contortion of his body.

The kills are delightfully cruel, and Eli Roth stages them all with plenty of energy.

Insane that they just didn't end up making a sequel worth a damn. A summit of investigative plotting, with two disparate POVs ultimately converging - re-contexualizing an objective experience into an emotional epic.

Two great actors elevating a traditional rom-com into a high-wire act of passion and longing. A romance that refuses to offer cheap laughs or misguided emotion. Sexy as fuck while still being a heartbreaker. Keanu Reeves and Frances McDormand are great too, but it's all about the Movie Star energy of the two leads. A Nancy Meyers classic!     ",

About as funny as anything he ever made, with riffs on the wonderment of this miraculous and terrible world. There are hints of Nashville but it's more easy-going and aware of itself.

Doors, hallways, and wallpaper manifest into specters of pummeling evil, and along with the wondrous sound design, Robert Wise's The Haunting culminates in a film that morphs into the form of a desperate human soul, searching for escape in endless caverns of parading isolation.   It's a film that reeks of secrets, but hidden under a uniquely classical surface,...     ",

Their dedication to the material is the reason why a majority of the film goes down so smooth. On the other hand, the rest felt shockingly sub par, with...     ",
      "coherence": "8/10 72/100  Coherence, directed by James Ward Byrkit, is a jumbled cinematic math problem. Chaos and paranoia leads to dismantling relationships and a finely tuned sense of shredded understanding, and it is within the opening stages of its algorithm-esque structure where the film rises into the realm of the spectacular. It's eerie, undeniably engrossing, and filmed with a shaky eye towards family and the distinct issues that fill the cracks of such an interconnected system.   However, Coherence, while nothing less than...     ",

Every aspect revolves around the fuzzy, strange, and complex feelings radiating from the heart, and Fall shifts into Winter within 30 seconds because it's a flourishing aspect of the film's operatic humanism. The end feels like a sly way to contradict its inner themes without drawing criticism, and it's a shame because...     ",
      "the-martian": "8/10 77/100  Rigorously grounded and minimalist, The Martian succeeds because it feels like a wondrous celebration of Ridley Scott's gorgeous eye for expanses and the turmoil that bellows within. More than anything else, The Martian worships science and its ability to overcome problems, and as a result, terrifying horror and distinct victory oozes from Scott's tight direction. This is a 2 hour and 20 minute adventure, and it feels longer than that, but in a good way of course. It's a drawn-out spectacle that surprisingly flows as a cohesive story of intimacy and vast discovery. I found it inspiring.     ",

Denis Villeneuve, teaming up again with master DP Roger Deakins, conjures up images of supreme darkness, but the true accomplishment comes not from horror within the now but from the foreboding blare of escalating dread.

      "a-man-escaped": "8/10 75/100  Process, process, process. Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped focuses more on the different valleys and peaks of reaching an end goal rather than the consequences of such tribulations. It's a film comprised of footsteps, whispers, minor errors, minor victories, and the celebratory rush of triumph over hardship.   While most films \"fade to black\" to signify an end or a particular moment of importance, the key to A Man Escaped is its usage of the fade as an assured step into danger and the reluctant quest for hope. For Bresson, every movement and action is just the beginning.     ",

Viewing a Sirk film is like knowingly diving into a kiddie pool, embracing its mush and melodrama, but as soon as you hit the water, its depths are unexpected and gorgeously profound.

Even with some comedic moments that don't quite hit their mark, McKay's film is an outrageously goofy and grounded buddy cop extravaganza. Ferrell and Wahlberg were practically made for each other, and their emasculating/macho dynamic is nothing less than side-splitting. Wahlberg's facial expressions in particular are just fucking hilarious.   However,...     ",

Godfrey's Reggio's film flows like a blank slate of visual/aural stimulus, provoking each viewer in a profoundly individualized way, and in return, Koyaanisqatsi molds into whatever the viewer is seeking.

Akira Kurosawa has always been one for character-driven spectacle, but in this Macbeth-translation, he lets Toshir\u00f4 Mifune off the leash in a ghostly labyrinth of everlasting fog and haunting shrieks.

Abbas Kiarostami takes conventions of Art-House cinema and shoves those norms right in front of a full-body mirror, forcing genre and normality to confront their own limitations and customs.

Ben Gazzara is a magnetic presence, and he grounds the film in a way that prevents the story from crumbling under the weight of Cassavetes' prominent interest in unorthodox styling.   The Killing of a Chinese Bookie feels like another example of a performer gluing a story together from previous remnants, and while I admire the craft, it's another example of a Cassavetes film leaving me lukewarm.

Brief Encounter isn't so much a \"romance\" film as it is a piece of cinema about the gradual fluttering of feelings within a culture of preconceived notions.

Starting out as an uninteresting slow-burn, the performances by Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, and Joel Edgerton keep the viewer engaged by committing to the material and aiding the creeping direction. However, Edgerton takes this simple, almost lifetime-esque formula, and subverts its own very cliches and rules in beautifully cinematic ways. It's a film that does exactly what it sets out to do, and although its ambitions are rather spare, the chillness that flows through The Gift is too accomplished to be ignored.     ",

Feeling like a children's book retelling that suddenly had an overhaul of a rewrite by Frank Miller, this little Frankenstein monster of a Batman installment is delirious and entertaining in a way that millennial schlock frequently sidelines.

The magical stop-motion effects still are unmistakably brilliant, and combined with the marvelous matte work, this 1933 classic is unrelentingly vital, never stopping and always providing a genuine aura of spectacle.

His subjects can be considered strange, odd, quirky, and peculiar, but Morris understands the mesmerizing tangibility and the restful beauty behind that ideal. In Vernon, Florida, which is 55 minutes of serene observations of people and their environment, the world seems to be at a standstill. Light enriches the trees at a slower rate, benches are occupied by the same fellow for the entire day, and...     ",

No matter the problem or the issue, no matter how modern or ancient in its magnitude; the hero must go on a quest to heal the wounds of The Fisher King, one who is lost, lonely, and in need of purity to cleanse the dirt within his inflicted damages. The emotional anguish and the heartbreak is too much to bear, for when dark times rain down...     ",
      "out-of-the-past": "9/10 89/100  For a film so indelibly involved in the lost rivers of memory, Out of the Past confounds because of its ever-present feeling within the now. Every frame feels like the mistakes and the pain of the past will reach out and strangle our main characters, but that never stops the main mystery from propelling forward with impeccable fluidity. The chemistry between Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer is some of the finest to ever emerge out of the film-noir genre,...     ",

Twisted, dark, feverishly cynical, and hungrily steamy from the first filthy frame to the last ironic mic drop; Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole crafts a chaotic atmosphere while simultaneously building human relationships and wrapping an organic message around its snappy screenplay. Everything just flies off the screen in a way that only Billy Wilder can orchestrate. Kirk Douglas is life.     ",

Michelangelo Antonioni's brilliant abandonment of conventional narrative simultaneously plays as both a hidden lie and an outspoken cry of anguish.

Incorporating a typical rise and fall narrative works wonders, especially since it allows for a consistent tone, destroying any \"hope\" for an overblown finale.

The humor is hit or miss, the pacing is way out of wack, and the references are shockingly obvious and annoyingly prevalent. Danger 5 did this better two years ago. Amazingly epic one-liners and laser raptor saves this from being a complete disaster, but otherwise, I'll stick to throwbacks that don't jumble their own influences into a mishmashy whole.     ",

Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller commit to the goofy antics of Rawson Thurber's screenplay and the result is one of the best 80s comedies not released in the 1980s. Everybody swings for the fences in this and DodgeBall manages to get away relatively unscathed. Jason Bateman's character shouldn't work at all and somehow it totally does.  Sometimes you just gotta grab life by the ball.     ",

All the faults that Matthew Vaughn brought to his most recent film (the obnoxious clusterfuck of tones, stop and start pacing, meta meta meta) are minimized here to great effect.

Miller's directing, Cliff Hayes and Tony Paterson's editing, David Eggby's cinematography, and Brian May's score all comes together into a type of visual shock treatment. You can smell the gasoline radiating off of the screen, and in spite of some rough patches with the pacing and some budget constraints, Mad Max continues to be a dazzling ride.

Snore-inducing, boring, as dead as a beached whale; Captain America: The Winter Soldier brings up lofty discussion but can't support that weight with anything remotely interesting or fresh. It's two hours of Cap fighting samey enemies, shot shakily, lazily framed, and overly ambitious for the current stakes of the MCU at the time of release. And to top it all off, It has the most bland and non-cinematic look of any movie ever made. Seriously Marvel, don't try to put an Agents of Shield episode on the big screen again.

Skeletons don't just appear out of nowhere. Or do they?   A full-fledged, peerless, and dreamy masterwork.

Many moments are just downright scary, and while a message gets in the way of going into REALLY dark territory near the end; it's forgivable considering the target audience.   It isn't classic Joe Dante, but it proves he still is alive and loving horror cinema.   And forget Poltergeist , this might have the scariest moment involving clowns. Ever.  *Shivers*     ",
      "touch-of-evil": "9/10 Viewed the Reconstructed version on Blu-ray.  Picture this:  Infinite darkness. At once so close and at the same time, so far away. Endlessly drifting closer, sending your nerves into a dizzying panic of heightened hysteria and emotional turmoil, is your greatest fear. It's coming closer, closer, closer, closer, closer. At that point, you cannot move. Your physical body is frozen, yet your mental state is as frenzied as an abused animal; lost and alone. You feel it. The touch of...     ",
      "american-psycho": "9/10 American Psycho is an utter masterpiece of satire and social commentary, backed by an outrageous performance by Christian Bale. This film would be nothing without Bale, who brings a cosmic force of ferocity to the screen, completely unhinged and loving every minute.  However, American Psycho is also a brilliant and stunning discussion on the fine line between a sane and insane individual. Viewing through Mary Marron's voyeuristic lens, It seems that every single one of Patrick Bateman's coworkers are just...     ",
      "dumb-and-dumber": "10/10 \"Hey, wait a second..... What was all that one-in-a-million talk?\"  Every line in this film can be classified as this:  Brilliantly stupid.     ",
      "frozen-2013": "7/10 One star for the stunning and immaculate animation.   Two stars for Olaf and his obsession with accidental suicide.   Half a star for a tired and worn story masterfully told.   Not the classic many have claimed, but an enjoyable piece of animation in its own way.     ",
      "8-half": "9/10 Federico Fellini. I've heard so much. As countless others have proclaimed, he was a master of the cinema. So, with massively high expectations, I dove head-first into my first Fellini.   Simply put, 8 1/2 is magical.   I have never seen a film that weaves in and out of a man's hopes, dreams, memories, desires, and worries so seamlessly. In fact, there is nothing like this. Nothing. I sat slack-jawed for 138 minutes, trying to comprehend how one individual could dream...     ",

I don't think I have ever \"felt\" such depth in a piece of cinema before.   I will \"attempt\" a full review after a rewatch, which will probably be very soon. Maybe. I don't know. This film broke me.     ",
      "like-father-like-son-2013": "8/10 Like Father, Like Son is a mostly riveting and emotionally draining drama about two families who discover that their respective children had been switched at birth. Hirokazu directs the film with a calm assurance, slowing drawing the audience into this subtle and carefully calculated study of parenthood.   The film occasionally stumbles, mostly in regards to the slow pacing, yet the wonderful moments of character and expression shine through.   However, the cinematography, screenplay, direction, and acting is all top-notch; and the emotional current running throughout the story is simply breathtaking.   A little side-note, the movie really brings the feels. Be ready for some tears.     ",
      "sightseers": "6/10 Different, artistic, shocking, graphic, and quite funny; Sightseers is an odd little piece of work from director Ben Wheatley (A Field in England, Kill List). Basically, the film is about a relatively-new couple on a vacation, touring around England. I don't want to spoil much else, because Sightseers is heavily reliant on surprises and tonal shifts.   My relatives picked this because they wanted to see a comedy about tourists. What they got was something much better, and definitely something different....     ",
      "the-many-adventures-of-winnie-the-pooh": "8/10 Simple and charming animation + a fantastic voice cast + beautiful musical numbers + a relaxed and loose pace = one good movie.  I really didn't want to watch this, but I'm staying with relatives who have a 2 year old son, so complaining wasn't an option.   Don't complain. Sit down and watch it. I don't care if its childish, get over yourself and enjoy the experience. Honestly, I couldn't believe how beautiful this was.   Calm and subdued in all the best ways.     ",
      "source-code": "7/10 Source Code, directed by Duncan Jones, is a genuinely moving sci-fi thriller; one that feels like the film Non-Stop was trying to be.   The logic is completely off, but who cares when the film is just so entertaining and poignant. Jake Gyllenhaal's struggle to find himself is wonderfully structured, and the ending is simply awesome; making sure that a true resolution is reached, and not just another twist for twists sake.   In conclusion, Source Code is pretty cool.   If only Michelle Monaghan didn't smile so much.     ",
      "gates-of-heaven": "9/10 Gates of Heaven is a sublimely strange and engrossing experience. Errol Morris's documentary on Pet Cemeteries and the owners who contributed their deceased pet there is simply exceptional, combining quirky individuals that seem both goofy and melancholic. And yet, their flaws make their stories so compelling and fascinating.   The Awesome: The stories layered with dark humor, some so dark that you're not sure whether to tear up with sadness or laughter. Truly, the story about a cat stuck in a...     ",
      "the-time-machine-2002": "3/10 The Time Machine (2002) is actually a pretty decent remake, until the final 15 minutes completely derail and become something different entirely. Honestly, the action in the climax was so boring, It could be used as a sleep remedy.   Guy Pierce is awesome though.     ",
      "rv": "1/10 Staying with relatives can bring both great joy and turmoil. Usually with me, all of the turmoil is caused by the constant viewing of their movie choices. Now, they've picked a few great ones (The Tree of Life and Poltergeist), but mostly, this has been a new low in my film-watching lifestyle.   In regards to this atrocity, the only positive I can think of is a sequence involving the drainage of sewage. The sole reason why I enjoy this scene...     ",

      "monsters-university": "8/10 Monsters University is a second-tier Pixar production to be sure, however, is that a bad thing? Full of lush visuals, excellent humor, and a wonderful message about growing up; Monsters University is a really good animated film for the whole family.   \"I can't go back to jail!\"     ",
      "snowpiercer": "7/10 Snowpiercer, despite many flaws, can't help but entertain and enthrall. The utter messiness of the screenplay and the odd texture of the entire production enhances those flaws, conjuring up a piece of work that can only be described as being different.   I just don't know about this movie. On one hand, the incredible acting and action sequences kept me gripped and interested. On another hand, characters got up and left without warning, and some presumably \"died\" of fatal wounds, only...     ",
      "year-one": "5/10 Goofy, silly, stupid, juvenile, and silly.   This movie has Jack Black making frog noises.   Sure, the film isn't that funny overall, but some moments had me rolling on the floor.     ",
      "into-the-wild": "8/10 Into the Wild is a wondrous and breathtaking journey, taking the viewer on a spiritual quest that feels just as life-affirming and joyous as any film that I have seen. Emile Hirsch just kills it in the lead role, cementing my opinion that he's one of the most underrated actors working today.   I don't have much more to say about it. Into the Wild is a personal experience, one that will work much better when viewed alone.     ",
      "the-big-year": "2/10 So, I'm watching this, and I'm having a hard time staying awake. Pure boredom.   Then, the sound designer decides to mix the film so a Coldplay song plays at maximum volume, making me spill my Pringles.   I just don't know what to say, this sucked.     ",
      "the-last-trapper": "5/10 The Last Trapper is a film that I found scouring video shops in France, a country I am currently visiting. With no reviews on this little gem, It seems fitting to give a quick synopsis on the film.   Basically, The Last Trapper shows the daily life of a particular trapper who resides in the untamed beauty of Alaska. With deforestation looming over his current land, the trapper must find a new area to resume his troublesome work.   Overall, The Last...     ",

      "parental-guidance-2012": "2/10 A deplorable and disgusting piece of sentimental trash, one that relies on the great personality and humor of Billy Crystal to find laughs.  Let's face it, Billy is awesome, but he couldn't save this movie. Even if he tried.     ",
      "i-saw-the-devil": "10/10 Full review will come after a re-watch, but I will tell you this.  I have never seen a more operatic, beautiful, and frightening film than I Saw the Devil.

      "the-haunted-mansion": "7/10 Yes. I'm giving The Haunted Mansion 3.5 stars. Now, please. Hear me out. This isn't nostalgia talking. I find The Haunted Mansion to be an excellent family film, one that has plenty of scares for children. Yes, they can handle it. Honestly, some people are so protective anymore. I saw Halloween (1978) when I was eight years old, and I'm not that weird.   The Awesome: In all seriousness, I really dig this movie. Eddie Murphy is funny in this, and...     ",
      "how-to-train-your-dragon-2": "9/10 How to Train Your Dragon 2 is just as wonderous and stunning as the first film. I went in with MASSIVE expectations, and needless to say, I shouldn't have worried. Truthfully, I think Dreamworks knows that they can't screw up this franchise. They don't have room for error.   The Awesome: The characters and where the story takes them is the greatest achievement in HTTYD2. Multi-layered, emotional, and flawed individuals are common place in this series, and this darker tale is...     ",

The imagery is haunting, the soundtrack is so beautiful it makes your heart ache, and many moments left me speechless. However, I also found the film to be overly-long and slow, with the story and characters failing to connect on any level.

X-Men: Days of Future Past surpassed all of my expectations, bringing truly exceptional character and intense drama together with great humor and visceral action sequences.

However, Its respect for the characters and material that preceded it makes X-Men: First Class something truly special.   The Awesome: Michael Fassbender. James McAvoy. Wow. After every re-watch, their performances and dedication to their respective characters impress me to no end. Honestly, the final 10 minutes of this movie...     ",
      "x2": "8/10 Boasting better and more varied action set pieces to go alongside the wonderful characters that were present in the first film, X2: X-Men United is a noticeable improvement from the first installment.

I've seen bits and pieces of the first two films, but the only one that I have seen entirely is First Class, which I greatly enjoyed. So, going back into this politically charged series was exciting, and I have to say; the first X-Men is a really enjoyable...     ",

      "godzilla-vs-mechagodzilla-ii": "8/10 Another Godzilla film watched, and this time, It's a great one.   The seriousness of the story is matched well with the incredible battles, making for one of the best final fight scenes in Godzilla's history.   Also, Baby Godzilla is much easier to stomach than \"Son of Godzilla\".   Overall, Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla II is one of the best Godzilla entries, and I highly recommend that you check it out before the new film comes out on Friday.     ",
      "how-to-train-your-dragon": "10/10 The genre of animation is truly wonderful. At its peak, the works of hundreds of animation artists and supervisors culminate to make films that can easily be described as transcendental. Truly, films like Don Hertzfeldt's \"It's Such A Beautiful Day\" and Disney's \"Bambi\" tell stories with incredible passion and beauty, unconstrained from the limits of live-action cinema.   \"How To Train Your Dragon\" is another example of the pinnacle of animation. Simply put. It's a modern classic, a masterpiece, a stunning...     ",

While Oculus isn't the second coming of horror, It was a decent time waster, with excellent editing and some good performances.   The Awesome: The mirror in this movie is so mean. Man, I couldn't believe some of the stuff it pulled off. The slowly increasing bending of reality and fantasy makes way for a...     ",

      "prisoners": "9/10 Prisoners is another incredible work from director Denis Villeneuve, whose filmography I am particularly fond of. He understands the concept of suspense and tension, while simultaneously building character and the themes the film is built on. Prisoner's theme is primarily focused on morals, and how they affect the person you become. An uneven and slightly unsatisfying final twist keeps Prisoners from becoming five star material, but those first two-thirds give us the greatest thriller since Fincher's Zodiac.   The Awesome: This...     ",

      "pet-sematary": "8/10 Pet Sematary is one of the most disturbing horror films ever made, and certainly the most tragic. Dealing with the loss of a child, and the gradual descent to madness as a result of that loss, it's depressing and wonderfully creepy. Sure, it's pretty dated and cheesy at points, but what every horror fan remembers is the imagery.   The Awesome: The imagery, the imagery, the imagery. Macabre, horrifying, creepy, startling, and just plain scary; Pet Sematary has moments that will...     ",

The back of the Criterion states: \"There was before Breathless, and after Breathless.\" That couldn't be more true; the editing, the music, the camerawork was and still is revolutionary. The acting was great as...     ",

Adding surrealism, dark humor, social commentary and existentialism into the mix, Rejected is the perfect representation of a shattered psyche.   The Awesome: Every minute of this masterpiece. The gut-busting humor, which made me laugh harder than any film that I have ever seen. The jaw-dropping ending, that brings the...     ",

Many cite Hard Eight (Sydney) as PTA's weakest film, and I have to disagree. Hard Eight may be more low key, less flashy and solemn in tone; but the layers of dread, mystery and danger make this one of Paul Thomas Anderson's finest achievements.

      "short-term-12-2013": "8/10 Short Term 12 is a powerful little film; one so moving and tender that when it ended, I had the urge to start it again.   The Awesome: The natural and wonderful acting from both the children and the workers, each bringing their own take to their character. The story was lively, funny and sad; the director really understood how to tell this story.   The Terrible: The cinematography is bland and the film is mainly composed of shaky-cam, intruding on some of the more emotional scenes.   Overall, Short Term 12 is a great little film that I hope will never be forgotten. It deserves an audience.     ",
      "the-driver": "5/10 A film that greatly inspired Drive (2011), Walter Hill's The Driver supports fantastic car chases on top of a minimalist narrative.   The Awesome: The car chases: fast, exciting and greatly filmed; they are some of the best around. The climax which is exciting and tense ties the story together. The cinematography is wonderful.   The Terrible: Not much happens. It's a minimalist narrative, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just isn't my taste.  Overall: A couple great car chases and fantastic cinematography doesn't save a narrative that could be told in 20 minutes.     "
