      "coco-2017": "8/10 Loved it. Amazing animation, super colorful and overall exciting. Might be Pixar's best work in terms of animation. In terms of a story I feel like it had some more potential for humor in it, but oh well. Liked it a lot.     ",
      "dunkirk-2017": "7/10 While it does feel like a movie I should like because everyone else likes it, I still really like it. AMAZINGLY shot and great performances all around. I have nothing to say that hasn't already been said about it.     ",
      "manchester-by-the-sea": "7/10 Not sure I could watch it again, but that doesn't mean this wasn't a great film. Sooo well written and amazingly shot. Don't really need to say much about the performances. Really well done.     ",
      "hail-caesar-2016": "5/10 Wasn't bad, wasn't great. One of the most average films I've ever seen. Pretty disappointing considering what I was expecting but oh well.     ",
      "deadpool": "9/10 Lol I really liked it. Super funny and awesome watching this kind of story done on such a high budget.     ",
      "sausage-party": "1/10 I really wanted to like this film. Especially considering it would have been a great breakthrough for adult animation but I can't think of a more immature and lazy way this could have been done. Not really funny at all and horribly animated. While it sure isn't the worst thing I've ever seen I might go ahead and label it as my least favorite movie just because of how offensive, unnecessary, stupid, abd just fucking horrible it is.     ",
      "the-jungle-book-2016": "7/10 Good date film. Few corny moments here and there but great adaptation.     ",
      "captain-america-civil-war": "5/10 Much better than what I expected. Definitely made Iron Man a bit more interesting than he's been as of recent. Great action sequences. Like most Marvel films the colour correcting was annoyingly muddy and its stay was a tad overdue but oh well, I enjoyed it.     ",
      "hell-or-high-water": "8/10 Saw this with Will R first quarter, first time at Landmark. Definitely one of my favourites of the past year. Well shot, well written, well acted. Super badass with a soft side to it. Should have received a bit more attention in my opinion.     ",
      "finding-dory": "8/10 While I am totally against Pixar's recent sequel phase, I think this film gets much more hate than it deserves. Really well done besides some of the excessive Nemo references in the beginning. Loved it.     ",
      "kubo-and-the-two-strings": "9/10 Beautifully animated, definitely need to watch again.     ",
      "la-la-land": "9/10 Love this movie more than I love myself     ",
      "arrival-2016": "9/10 Saw this with my friend Nihal last minute the last night it was showing. Really had no expectations based on what I had been hearing. Usually not a sci-fi and was pleasantly surprised when I realised it wasn't exactly that. Totally mind blowing and stunningly shot. Overall great film.     ",
      "rogue-one-a-star-wars-story": "5/10 My friend put it very well when he described the film as a comic book series that would have gone to waste if not turned into a film. Totally worth making, definitely not unnecessary. I'm sure if I knew a little bit more about the Star Wars franchise I would understand and appreciate more than I did, but not knowing about the world the film is based around for a film entirely made for the people do isn't a reason to get upset about it. Looks great visually and my god that third act was amazing.     ",
      "passengers-2016": "3/10 Haha eh...the beginning was okay but boy oh boy did it go downhill first.     ",
      "get-out-2017": "9/10 Went to this one on a date with my girlfriend, totally lives up to the hype it's gotten. Can't really find a flaw in it. Can't really say it's something I'm able to keep coming back to but from a technical standpoint, absolutely nailed it. Also, that poster looks so slick.     ",
      "the-lego-batman-movie": "6/10 Anything this animation company puts out that involves LEGO is automatically going to go over well for me just because of how crazy good it all looks. Like, dog...it looks so cool. But in terms of the movie, some of the jokes fell a little flat for me and the raps...agh /:     ",
      "guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2": "7/10 Much funnier than the first but lacks the same clear and concise storyline. Pretty messy and not very consistent with it's pacing but my god it's colourful as hell and, like I said earlier, very funny. Super fun which is what this franchise is, and should be, all about.     ",
      "rango": "7/10 I remember seeing this when I was in like 7th grade which was right around the time I started getting into film and I remember just being blown away by the visuals and creativity in the animation. Not very memorable or clear in terms of a story, a little messy, but a fun one.     ",
      "napoleon-dynamite": "8/10 I made a video essay about this a little bit ago. I think it's one of my favourite comedies ever and continues to make me laugh despite how many times I've watched this thing. Only giving it 4 because, as much as I defended this in the essay, it really does lack a story and a sense of emotional attachment but who really cares it's hilarious.     ",
      "amy-2015": "10/10 One of if not the best documentary I saw of that year. I saw at the Uptown theater with my mom. It was my first time seeing it but her second. Despite the fact that it was her second time she cried, and I couldn't blame her. Heartbreaking but inspirational.     "
