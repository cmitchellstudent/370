Adra was only five years old at the time, but he can still remember the fear of that violation as if it only happened yesterday.   In part, that's because it did; raised in an occupied territory under Apartheid conditions, Adra has never known...     ",

I guess you can't have too many of those. \"Sons,\" at least, is a richer and more probing thing than M\u00f6ller's debut, even if the pointed questions that it forces out of its hyper-contained premise ultimately make this...

On the contrary, you might find that losing someone can help you to find them in places you never thought to look when they were alive; distance can allow for clarity, and that clarity can allow for a new kind of closeness.   Bad news: That process is fraught with unanswerable questions, and we're thinking up weird new ones to ask every day....     ",
      "la-cocina-2024": "6/10 If \"the kitchen as war zone\" has become a veritable sub-genre unto itself, Alonso Ruizpalacios' \"La Cocina\" is the closest thing it has to its own \"Gallipoli.\" The trenches are made out of stainless steel instead of rotten wood, and the steady bombardment of orders comes with a greater threat of deportation than it does that of immediate death, but a job at The Grill just outside of Times Square is no less dehumanizing than a deployment along the frontlines...

An uncomplicated and reverent tribute that was shot before the late maestro's death in 2020 (and would feel like a two-and-a-half-hour tribute reel if not for the fact that Morricone himself is the film's most frequent talking head), this straightforward biodoc is almost perversely generic for a movie that's meant...
