      "dune-part-two": "10/10 That's it. That's the best sci fi ever made  There is simply nothing that could ever be as spectacular, as grand, as well thought out, as beautiful, as fucking AMAZING  This is a movie that exists only once in a generation. A story that grabs you and pulls you in. Enticing you to follow the journey until you're ripped to shreds from exhaustion  There is a scale here that could only be accomplished today in this time of our species....     ",

      "perfect-days-2023": "10/10 Adorable, beautiful, and heartbreaking  How can we continue our mundane day to day. Appreciate the small things around us. Take inventory of everything that makes us feel fulfilled. Never stop taking the small moments to breath in between  It'll be difficult sometimes and sometimes our satisfying routine might be broken but if we can continue to keep looking at the experiences given to us in the right light then we'll be okay  The music is beautifully used  I also went to the bathroom to piss for a moment so it was like full immersion I was really in the movie     ",
      "the-lobster": "10/10 This was very formative for my movie taste when i was in high school  The comedic timing is immaculate and the performances are so perfect. The goofy shooting range fight being one of my favorite examples of just awkward stiff people knocking each other around like wooden children  I love letting the audience be forced to understand the message and emotions and how it makes some people just too weirded out even to this day  It's beautifully shot and the...

I'm gonna be really sad that i finished my first watched for this trilogy but I'm grateful for the journey that I went on  Watching the extended version for all of these has given me such a massive appreciation for everything they represent\u00a0  When everyone kneeled for the hobbit crew at the end I fucking wept. These boys are absolute legends and no one will ever come close\u00a0  Incredible battles, music, performances. Such a great story and satisfying lore  This shit really had it all and I'll be looking to recapture this feeling for the rest of my life     ",

      "the-taste-of-things": "9/10 I just love seeing people being masters at their craft  The elegance and passion not extruding from a pompous self centered nature but a pure unfiltered enjoyment of dedicating yourself to something as beautiful as cooking  The romance is slowly simmering, the setting is golden and baked  The music never showing its face in favor of hearing each silent emotion that comes with such a tasking yet rewarding activity\u00a0  My man was grunting, puffing and breathing all up in the mic like yo, HES LOCKED INNNN  Absolutely beautiful movie     ",

This movie is able to send chills down your spine and somehow cut to a guy looking at dicks in a bath house and keep both tones in check.
