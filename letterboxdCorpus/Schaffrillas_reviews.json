The use of music to highlight those fleeting moments of happiness and fulfillment in Frances' life was inspired. Black-and-white cinematography didn't seem necessary but it's hard to complain when the film is visually stunning regardless.

As a musical, this one is kinda weird; there are less songs than usual, which I guess is owed to the more serious, war-like tone.
