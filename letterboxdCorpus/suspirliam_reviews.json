Everyone's performances were truly outstanding and felt so incredibly real! From start to finish I was hooked and literally couldn't look away (despite the violent parts lol)!\u00a0  This film was so raw and that's what made it really hit me hard. The character developments and story were so beautifully done. I know I will never be forgetting this film.     "
