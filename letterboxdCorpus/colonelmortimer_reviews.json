Going back to the big guy as an elemental representation of national trauma and a force of nearly pure malevolence -- although crucially not one of judgment was a great call.

Anyway, pretty naive, certainly sanded down from the source, but it's also 40 years old, and of course it's loaded with great performances and he shoots the hell out of it. Extremely Ford-ian, including what it chooses to depict with humor. Also it ain't like too many people were making movies like this about Black women in 1985, and certainly not folks with the profile of biggest filmmaker in Hollywood.

      "anatomy-of-a-fall": "6/10 I came around on this eventually, mostly due to the truly terrific centerpiece marital combat. But I was largely disinterested in the courtroom stuff, I'm sorry. What we're left with here is the clinical investigation of a melodrama, without much actual melodrama. The outcome of the case barely matters, which you could certainly argue is exactly the point, but, like...so what? That's a stupid point. Anyway H\u00fcller is absolutely as good as you've heard. Honestly reminded me of OPPENHEIMER in...     ",
      "gran-turismo": "6/10 Largely a boilerplate inspirational sports story but as usual Blomkamp's genuine visual skill and obsession with people merging in some way with tech sets this apart in some productive ways. Great race scenes, best drone stuff since AMBULANCE.     ",

But what I wouldn't give for there to be some actual jeopardy in one of these comedies that's so hellbent on inclusivity with a boringly safe side of raunch! I sincerely don't care who wants to fuck who, but I'm begging you, try to buy booze underage, find a gun, blow some rails, steal a car, be afraid of the cops, actually have sex, get in some fucking trouble.

      "shiva-baby-2020": "5/10 Funny! But stick with me: this woman is repeatedly denied agency by this movie, which doesn't even allow her the option of just abandoning all of these monsters, none of whom act even a little bit like they care about her even while she hopelessly indulges their insults, betrayals of confidence, and -- disguised or not -- intentional inflictions of psychic harm. Certainly there also is some dimension of this that is about filial piety specific to religion, but that was admittedly lost on me beyond its obvious implication.     ",

In this case I don't think he's really in control of the implications of the material, which he treats as intrinsically provocative without really interrogating those provocations beyond their self-evidence.

And holy hell, such glorious video. Very much what you'd have had if Tony Scott had had his brother's aspirations to good taste, so much so that I think this was, in one way or another, certainly made in tribute.     ",

      "starting-over": "7/10 So Brooks-ian it's almost impossible to believe it was directed by the guy who made PARALLAX VIEW and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. On the other hand I don't think it's served well by mostly sticking to Reynolds' POV (he might also be miscast although I appreciate the swing), and I also don't think Brooks would ever let Bergen's character be so desperately needy today. Clayburgh however is giving an all-timer, a quintessentially self-critical Brooks character overpowered by doubt and motivated by insight. Almost a great movie.     ",
