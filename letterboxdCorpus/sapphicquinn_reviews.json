      "pet-sematary-2019": "3/10 It's a shame this is as bad as it is because it had a lot of potential. Unfortunately the pacing is awful, none of the characters are interesting, the directing is lifeless (no pun intended) and the only thing scary about this film are some of the performances. Apart from occasional glimpses of some scary imagery and some pretty decent body horror special effects it's a huge let down. Honestly I'd rather watch the other pet sematary film from 1989 because at least that was entertaining, this is just incredibly dull.     ",
      "batman-1989": "10/10 30th anniversary re-release:  I think watching this in a cinema helped me appreciate it a lot more. Especially with Tim Burton's great directing and Danny Elfman's iconic score standing out a lot more. Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton both give stand out performances, with Jack Nicholson having so much screen presence and putting everything into the role.     ",
      "john-wick-chapter-2": "9/10 John Wick 2 does everything a good sequel should. It doubles down on the brutal and incredible action and expands on the unique world.     ",
      "bohemian-rhapsody": "1/10 Wasted potential. Rami Malek won an oscar for lip syncing and wearing a hilariously bad fake set of teeth. The editing is shockingly bad, the cinematography is decent at best and considering this is a biopic, it's weird how little this shows about Freddie Mercury's life instead choosing to use a cookie cutter story. The concert sequences in the film are decent but you could watch the real concerts on YouTube for free and get the same experience.\u00a0  Hopefully Rocketman will do the exact opposite and actually be good.     ",
      "baywatch": "1/10 Aggressively bad     ",
      "the-host": "9/10 A highly effective monster film with a surprisingly emotional core.     ",
      "hop": "1/10 Quick question:  Why?     ",
      "turbo": "1/10 Dreamworks have probably turned down many great scripts yet greenlit a film about racing snails.     ",
      "keith-lemon-the-film": "1/10 This is without a doubt the worst film I have ever seen.     ",
      "the-harry-hill-movie": "1/10 Every now and then I'll remember this exists and wasn't some bizarre fever dream.     "
